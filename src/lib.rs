//!
//! This crate allows for generic manipulation of currencies (both real-world and
//! cryptocurrencies) via the [`Amount`] struct and the [`Currency`] trait.
//!
//! The [`Amount`] struct is able to represent arbitrary amounts of any supported [`Currency`]
//! with the ability to restrict the underlying currencies at compile-time to only allow
//! checked arithmetic operations and requires consuming an [`Option`] in all fallible
//! circumstances.
